# IRCTC-Mini-project
This is a C language-based program that simulates a simple ticket booking system for Indian Railways Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC). The program allows users to sign up, log in, and book train tickets with randomly generated PNR numbers and train names.

## Features

- **Ticket Booking**: Users can book tickets by entering their personal information such as name, age, gender, source, and destination.
- **PNR and Train Name Generation**: The system automatically generates a unique PNR number and assigns a random train name for each booking.
